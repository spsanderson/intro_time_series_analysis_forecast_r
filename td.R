### POSIXt classes in R
x = as.POSIXct("2019-12-25 11:45:34") # nr of seconds
y = as.POSIXlt("2019-12-25 11:45:34")
x
y # it gives the same output, but what is behind it?

unclass(x)
unclass(y)

# what does the number mean?
(50 * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60) - (5.5 * 60 * 60)
y$zone # extracting the elements from POSIXlt
x$zone # not possible since it is simply a number of seconds

# another class based on days
x = as.Date("2019-12-25")
x; 
class(x)
unclass(x)
50 * 365 - 5 # nr of days since 1970

library(chron)
x = chron("12/25/2019", "23:34:09")
x
class(x)
unclass(x)

### strptime
a = as.character(c("1993-12-30 23:45",
                   "1994-11-05 11:43",
                   "1992-03-09 21:54"))

class(a)

b = strptime(a, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")
b
class(b)

### Lets take a look at the package lubridate which has very useful time/date data functions
library(lubridate)

# different ways in how to input dates
ymd(19931123)
dmy(23111993)
mdy(11231993)

# lets use time and date together
mytimepoint <- ymd_hm("1993-11-23 11:23", tz = "Europe/Prague")
mytimepoint
class(mytimepoint)

# extracting the components of it
minute(mytimepoint)
day(mytimepoint)
hour(mytimepoint)
year(mytimepoint)
month(mytimepoint)

# we can even change time values within our object
hour(mytimepoint) <- 14
mytimepoint

# which time zones do we have available
OlsonNames()

# we can take a look at the most common time zones
# but be aware that the time zone recognition also depends on your location and machine

## lets check which day our time point is
wday(mytimepoint)
wday(mytimepoint, label=T, abbr=F) # label to display the name of the day, no abbreviation

# we can calculate which time our timepoint would be in another time zone
with_tz(mytimepoint, tz = "Europe/London")
mytimepoint

# time intervals
time1 = ymd_hm("1993-09-23 11:23", tz = "Europe/Prague")
time2 = ymd_hm("1995-11-02 15:23", tz = "Europe/Prague")

# getting the interval
myinterval = interval(time1, time2); myinterval
class(myinterval) # interval is an object class from lubridate

### Exercise: Creating a Data Frame with lubridate
# lets now build a dataframe with lubridate that contains date and time data
# see the different input formats that are allowed in the ymd function
a = c("1998,11,11", "1983/01/23", "1982:09:04", "1945-05-09", 19821224, "1974.12.03", 19871210)
a = ymd(a, tz = "CET") ;a

# now I am creating a time vector - using different notations of input
b = c("22 4 5", "04;09;45", "11:9:56", "23,15,12", "14 16 34", "8 8 23", "21 16 14")
b = hms(b); b
f = rnorm(7,10); f = round(f, digits = 2); f
date_time_measurement = cbind.data.frame(date = a, time = b, measurement = f)
date_time_measurement

## Calculations with time
minutes(7)

# note that class "Period" needs integers - full numbers
minutes(2.5)

# getting the duration
dminutes(3)
dminutes(3.5)

# how to add minutes and seconds
minutes(2) + seconds(5)

# more calculations
minutes(2) + seconds(75)

# class "duration" to perform addition
as.duration(minutes(2) + seconds(75))

# lubridate has many time classes: period or duration differ!
# which year was a leap year?
leap_year(2009:2014)
ymd(20140101) + years(1)
ymd(20140101) + dyears(1)

# lets do the whole thing with a leap year
leap_year(2016)
ymd(20160101) + years(1)
ymd(20160101) + dyears(1)

# as you see the duration is the one which is always 365 days
# the standard one (the period) makes the year a whole new unit (+1)

## Exercise Lubridate
# create x, with time zone CET and a given time point in 2014 of your choosing
# I use "2014-04-12 23:12"
# the time point consists of year, months, day and hour
# change now the minute of x to 7 and check x in the same line of code
# see which time it would be in London
# create another time point y in 2015 and get the difference between those 2 points
x = ymd_hm(tz = "CET", "2014-04-12 23:12")

minute(x) = 7 ; x

with_tz(x, tz="Europe/London")

y = ymd_hm(tz = "CET", "2015-12-12 09:45")

y-x
